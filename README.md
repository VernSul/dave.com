##Evaluation

The application is run on localhost:4000, serving the react app on the '/' route. The client side allows to record sights and retrieve them based on diffrent criterias. The unit test checks that the routes return the right values. I used PostgreSQL as a DB, because ElephantSQL makes cloud hosting easy and does not require to whitelabel client IP addresses. So anybody can run the application locally.
